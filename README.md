# NHL-Salary-Data
2005-2007 career earnings as of Feb.13.2021, data from HockeyZonePlus.

Write-up here:

The writeup data was calculated using total value of the players contracts being paid out equally over age 23-33 seasons, then compound interest is adding yearly. I don't really want to scrap year-by-year data from CapFriendly or Puckpedia but if anyone has the data handy and wants me to update this, I'd be more than happy to.
